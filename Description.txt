Simple garbage collector

1. we will register our possible structs to be used
2. allocate needed objects using function "xalloc"
3. set some of the allocated objects as root
  a. if some object is not root, and our MLD (Memory leakage detector) cant reach it
    meaning this object is causing memory leak

4. Running MLD algorithm and print reports
